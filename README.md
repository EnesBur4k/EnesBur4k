HELLO THERE! 👋

I am a first year Computer Engineering student at Suleyman Demirel University. I participate in various training programs to improve myself in the field of cyber security, for example Cisco CBROPS, Network Security Courses. My aim is to add value to the sector i will work in. I'm at the beginning of my journey but i think my learning speed is high and i can handle this job.
